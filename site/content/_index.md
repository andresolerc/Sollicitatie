      "You are one candidate of hundreds. Maybe thousands."

      "You get 10 seconds for a hiring manager to review your resume."

      Your resume better be outstanding (we show you actual, winning 6-figure resumes in the Dream Job program)

      Even better, don’t go through the front door

      We teach you how to navigate the hiring process with a warm introduction, a backdoor referral, or advanced techniques for standing out.

      "You're interviewing the company, too."


      Low-quality candidates read this and think, "Sure, but I'd be grateful to have any job. 

      Beggars can't be choosers." 

      High-quality candidates, on the other hand, take this very seriously and use it to their advantage.


      If you want to reinvent your career or make a big leap, how can you SHOW you're serious about the opportunity and a great choice for the role? 


      Don't be passive! Take control of the interview.


      If you don't, someone else will. And they'll get the job you want too.

    Today, I want to give you a different way of looking at your career. I call
    it YES and YES.


    If you're ready, this choice can change your life.


    It can give you a life of freedom, of possibility, and growth.


    But only you can make the decision.


    Only you know if it’s time. 


    If you’ve read this far, I suspect it’s time to make a change.


    The decision is up to you.


    As always, a year from now, you're going to be a year older. Will you be living the life you want?
